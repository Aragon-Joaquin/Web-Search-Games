# üéÆ Game Searcher - (Using the IGDB API)

The idea of the project principally relies on getting information about the games via user's input.
The code is not perfect and kinda clumsy since it's my first react project.

## ‚Ñπ Installation

Install it with the pack manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

```bash
  npm i Web-Search-Games
  cd Web-Search-Games
```

Or if you use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).

```bash
  pnpm i Web-Search-Games
  cd Web-Search-Games
```

## üî® Setting it up

1. Create a .env file in the root of the project.

</p>

2. Then, go to [TwitchDevelopers](https://dev.twitch.tv/) and log-in with your twitch account and go to your **console** and click on **"_Register your application_"**.

</p>

3. Once there, do the next steps:

- Add the route, that the project will be hosted on (default is **localhost:5173**) in OathVerification

- Copy your clientID

- Generate a new clientSecret (**DO NOT SHARE!!**)

</p>

4. And lastly, in the previous .env file created, create the next variables:

- VITE_CLIENT_ID=yourClientId
- VITE_CLIENT_SECRET=yourClientSecret

</p>

5. And for the last step, just do a simple:

```bash
  npm install
  npm run dev
```
